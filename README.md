Description: This program works with a given raw csv file in order to get it cleaned.

This python script with the help of copilot was created to fix those errors to place them into a new csv file.

How to run: python src/data_cleaning.py for windows, python3 src/data_cleaning.py for Mac or Linux. Will also need pandas & Pathlibs installed for setup.

Output: a clean csv file located in data/processed/sales_data_clean.csv
